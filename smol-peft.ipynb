It should be balanced, providing a mix of nutrients like protein, fiber, healthy fats, and some carbs. Let me brainstorm some options.\\n\\nMaybe start with a classic like avocado toast. It's popular and has good fats and fiber. Adding an egg or Greek yogurt could boost the protein. Oh, and maybe some veggies on top for extra nutrients. That could work.\\n\\nAnother option could be a smoothie. Smoothies are quick and can pack a lot of nutrients. Using spinach, banana, berries, and a protein powder or Greek yogurt would be good. Maybe add some nut butter for healthy fats. That's a solid choice too.\\n\\nOatmeal is another staple. Overnight oats are convenient. Mixing oats with milk, chia seeds, and fruits. Maybe add some nuts or seeds for crunch. It's high in fiber and can be customized.\\n\\nWhat about a breakfast bowl with quinoa or another grain? Topped with fruits, nuts, and a drizzle of honey or nut butter. That's another balanced option.\\n\\nI should also consider dietary restrictions. Maybe mention alternatives for those who are vegan, gluten-free, etc. For example, using almond milk instead of dairy in the smoothie or choosing gluten-free oats.\\n\\nPortion sizes and preparation time might be important too. The user might be looking for something quick or something they can prep ahead. The avocado toast is quick, the overnight oats can be prepped the night before.\\n\\nIncluding a variety of options gives the user choices based on their preferences and time. Let me structure the response with a couple of options, each with ingredients and preparation steps. Also, highlight the nutritional benefits of each.
